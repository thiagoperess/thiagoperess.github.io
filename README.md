# My Personal Home Page

This was my first project on the air. The static page. ** HTML **, ** CSS ** and ** Bootstrap ** were used for its development. Since the first version, I have been making some edits to improve your look. It contains some important information of mine, such as my social networks, contact, my portfolio as projects that I developed, and certificates obtained in my learning journey.
